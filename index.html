            <p class="portfolio"> I had a fun time learning HTML, CSS and folder organization. The instructions are very clear. However, I believe that web developement is a vast field to be in. A lot of things can be made by web developing. Regarding the reading, the
              <a class="links" href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">w3schools</a> is a very helpful in learning web development because the design and its structure are very easy to the eyes. Also, the cool thing about w3schools is that it uses
              a live coding scheme so you can observe your tweaks to the initial code and see it after pressing run. The <a class="link" href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/index.html">webstyle guide </a> was a bit too long and quite outdated in my opinion.

              a flowchart and realized its importance. Dr. Ritzhaupt's advice was right in making the flowchart first before coding the data validation, it makes the task much easier. I am looking forward to the next homework wherein we can use javascript
              libraries.

              whole program up. Using software libraries really are helpful as a programmer, these make programming so much easier and faster.

              the plain canvas is not really used in animation of concepts nowadays since user and/or companies want a more 3D and advanced graphics. I would have used threeJS if there was at least two weeks given for the deadline but I had a fun time

            <p class="portfolio"> This is probably my third time using PHP but first time being serious in using it. I really like that PHP is a server side scripting language so I have to agree that it is really powerful. At first, I did not understand how to see it because it needed a host/localhost to implement the php code.
              Sessions are also a breeze in PHP. I believe learning this language would be really helpful to me some time, especially if I want to be a Wall Street Programmer. This project did not make me sleep for one day. I learned that you just need to take a step back and relax if you're stuck programming something.
