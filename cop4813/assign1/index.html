      <p>When I was a kid, I kept on having visions about being in the technology field. During high school, I spent my time making websites and playing with music softwares since I was musically inclined. When I was about to go to college, I somehow lost
        my interest in technology because of family influence. Almost everyone in my family were in the medical field, hence, I chose dental medicine. In 2013, I had a big choice of moving here to the US. It was a big shock to me but it was probably the
        best thing that happened to my life. Why? I had a chance to change my path. </p>
      <p>I was working as an medical office manager because initially I decided to go into nursing school then continue my dental education after that. I was accepted in several nursing schools around the state. However, one midnight, there was a familiar
        voice in my dream, it was Steve Jobs telling me something. It was unclear at first but after 3 repetitions, it came up to me, he told me in my dream to apply into the computer science program at UNF. It was 3am when I suddenly woke up after that
        weird dream.
        <font color="green">After that, I applied, got accepted, and went to UNF School of Computing</font>
      </p>
      <p>I am now turning into a senior in the CS track. I re-built my web development business last week because of multiple request by a lot of business around the area asking me if I can make their websites. I have won and participated in several hackathons
        as well. I was also part of the UNF team that had won the 1st place on-site at the ACM Intercollegiate Programming competition in 2016. The biggest challenge for me right now is serving as the president of the IEEE-CS and the ACM at UNF.</p>
      <p>I'm currently building my skills right now to adapt into the future. I am about to build a technology company a year after I graduate. I currently building apps which I could not reveal any details of because it might be a big one. My crazy vision
        which people laugh at is that I'm envisioning Jacksonville as the next Silicon Valley. </p>
